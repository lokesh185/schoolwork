project synopsis : 

the objective of the project is make an application that make graphs / piecharts / visualises the data given in a sql data base and to save those graphs .
this project uses matplotlib for showing graphs , tkinter for the app that can make graphs .

Abstract:

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standardized programming language that's used to manage relational databases and perform various operations on the data in them. Initially created in the 1970s, SQL is regularly used not only by database administrators, but also by developers writing data integration scripts and data analysts looking to set up and run analytical queries. SQL is hard visualise so Graphical Viualiser have been used produce mind blowing graphs , which help us better understand the data we are working with. 

Problem statement:

Education institutions use web applications for training students and checking performance based on marks but there are no specific steps followed for prediction of students performance and take measures to improve performance.

Objective:

the objective of the project is make an application that make graphs / piecharts / visualises the data given in a sql data base and to save those graphs .
this project uses matplotlib for showing graphs , tkinter for the app that can make graphs .

Disadvantages:

Existing methods mostly work based on marks obtained from exams.

Algorithms are used for classifying students based on marks. 

Proposed system:

Dataset of other subject marks are taken as input and data set is processed with labels and features and then test split is performed on the dataset and then machine learning model is applied to dataset then the prediction is performed.

Advantages:

Before the final marks of all subjects are evaluated prediction can be performed.

Using a machine learning process automation of marks prediction can be done.
